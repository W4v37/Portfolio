### My contribution

In this project, I designed the fundamental point-and-click mechanics, such as the ability to navigate by clicking to move, interact with the environment, and manage the inventory. 
The inventory features encompass picking up, using, crafting, and uncrafting items.

### My contribution

In this project, as in the previous one, I oversaw the Card Engine. 
However, unlike the last project, each card featured a distinctive effect, and you and your opponents could have numerous status effects and special abilities. 
Additionally, I took charge of the save and load system, similar to my role in the previous project.
